## Announcements

A meetup for anyone interested in the technical side of Bitcoin. This isn’t your typical crypto event. We follow a Socratic format, meaning no presentations, no keynotes — just focused, question-driven discussion.

Whether you're a developer, researcher, builder, or simply a curious Bitcoiner, you're welcome here. Come prepared to think critically and question everything — especially what you think you know about Bitcoin.

Drinks and light snacks will be provided.
Free and open to anyone not afraid to dive into the real, technical side of Bitcoin.
